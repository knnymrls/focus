# Focus

**Focus** is more than just an app; it's your productivity companion, designed to help you minimize distractions and dive straight into your work. Born out of a personal need to enhance work efficiency without the hassle of navigating through endless to-do lists, Focus streamlines the process of getting things done. With a primary emphasis on a distraction-free initiation of work sessions, accompanied by a simplistic todo list management, this app isn't just another item on your productivity stack—it's the solution to it.

## Features

- **Timer**: A straightforward, no-frills timer that starts as you open the app, nudging you to commence work without procrastination.

### Why Focus?

In a world where distractions are just a click away, Focus brings back simplicity to your workflow. By intentionally omitting the option to delete todos, we encourage a less is more approach, reducing the urge to micromanage tasks and instead, spotlighting the essence of productivity—getting work done.
